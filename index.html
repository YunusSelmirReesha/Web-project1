                    Stars are born in massive clouds of dust and gas called nebulae. Gravity pulls the gas and dust
                    together, creating a protostar that heats up as it contracts.
                    When the temperature and pressure become high enough, nuclear fusion ignites at the core, and a new
                    star is born. This process can take millions of years
                    and occurs in stellar nurseries located in galaxies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a star is formed, it enters the main sequence phase where it spends most of its life fusing
                    hydrogen into helium. The size and mass of a star determine
                    its lifespan and the way it will eventually die—either quietly fading away or dramatically exploding
                    as a supernova.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding star formation helps scientists trace the history of the universe, study galaxy
                    formation, and even understand the origins of elements
                    that make up planets and life. It’s one of the most awe-inspiring phenomena in astrophysics.
